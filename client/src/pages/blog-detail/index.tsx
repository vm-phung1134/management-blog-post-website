          The development of the World Wide Web is a huge step forward in making
          information sharing globalized, fast and cost-effective. Smartphones
          allow us to capture information on the go, and the Internet of Things
          (IoT) is connecting us even more, creating demand for new media
          management systems in the form of headless content management systems
          (headless CMS).

              1. What is the Internet of Things
            </h3>
            <p className="leading-6">
              Internet of Things(IoT) is commonly used in internet-connected
              smart devices. Examples of IoT include smart home devices, like
              the Nest thermostat, virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa or
              Google Home, and smart wearable accessories, like Fitbit. Business
              IoT is also common, with bot-based warehouse management
              capabilities, traffic analysis sensors, smart weighing shelves and
              more. According toStatesman, by 2021, there will be more than 11
              billion IoT devices in use globally. By 2030, experts predict this
              number will reach more than 29 billion. Neil Patel, founder of
              KISSmetrics and former Forbes contributor, wrote that the internet
              is on its way to becoming "an indispensable thing". That is, for
              people living in developed cities, the internet will always play a
              role in society and home life through multiple devices, screens,
              speakers and touch points. Brands that want to reach consumers
              through these smart devices will need to find new ways to deliver
              content. That's when the headless CMS was born.
